Priority: high/medium/low
Complexity/effort: C1/C2/C4/C8 (weeks)

Zephyr:

- Complete TCP data unhappy paths (C2, high)
- Integrate with subsys/net/ip/connection.c (=>C2, high)
- Change the encoding of TCP sequence numbers in test protocol
  to string (C1, high)
- Add tcp_win_peek() (<C1, high)
- Add the support for IPv6 (C2, medium)
- Merge tcp_out() and conn_seq()/conn_ack() (<=C1, medium)
- Sanitize tp_input() (allow only JSON) (<C1, low)
- Drop the first version of the test protocol (C1, low)
- Make tp to register callback in order to be reusable (<C1, low)
- Slightly redo tp_seq_track() to be more generic and track also
  connection state changes (<=C1, low)
- Track all net bufs through test protocol tracking functions
  (currently only network buffers in TCP windows are tracked) (<=C1, low)
- Drop the _tcp_conn_delete toggle, switch to the reference counting (<=C1, low)
